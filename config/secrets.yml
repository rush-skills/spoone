# Your secret key is used for verifying the integrity of signed cookies.
# If you change this key, all old signed cookies will become invalid!

# Make sure the secret is at least 30 characters and all random,

# You can use `rake secret` to generate a secure secret key.

# Make sure the secrets in this file are kept private
